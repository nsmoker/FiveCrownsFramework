# Five Crowns Instructions
Dealing:

Deal three cards to each player in the game. During each subsequent round of the game, each player gets one more card until the final round with thirteen cards.
Any extra cards get placed into the draw deck (face down). Any discards are placed next to the draw deck (face up) and can also be drawn from.

Goal:

The goal of the game (in the first round) is to get three of a kind (same number, different suits) or a run of 3 (consecutive numbers, same suit).
In subsequent rounds, any groupings of three or larger are allowed, but groupings of two and one are never allowed.
Whoever gets three of a kind first puts their cards face up on the table and each player after them has one more turn to try to create three of a kind.
If a player is not able to make three of a kind, their cards are added up and added to their score.
A score of zero or as close to zero as possible is the most optimal score.

Points:

Card with numbers three through ten all have a point value of the number on the card.
Jacks are eleven points, Queens are twelve points, and Kings are thirteen points.
Jokers are fifty points and Wild cards are twenty points.

Rules:

For each round, the number of cards you have in your hand corresponds to the wild card for that round. So if there are 5 cards in your hand, all fives are wild. Twelve cards? Queens are wild
Each turn that a player has, they MUST draw and discard (from either the draw pile or the discard pile). Even if they draw and immediatly discard the same card.

The player left of the deal goes first and the game continues in that direction.

A player can only "go down" if every one of their cards fits into a grouping (run or multuple of a kind) of three or larger.

The player dealing rotates to the left after each game.

The game has eleven rounds in total; starting with three cards (when threes are wild) and ending with thirteen cards (then Kings are wild).

Points are added at the end of each round.

At the end, whoever has the lowest score is the winner.
